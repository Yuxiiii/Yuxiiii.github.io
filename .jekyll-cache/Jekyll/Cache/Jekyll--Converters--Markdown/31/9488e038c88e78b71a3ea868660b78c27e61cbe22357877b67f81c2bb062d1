<p>I forked the code from <a href="http://qiubaiying.github.io">qiubaiying‚Äôs blog</a>. And <a href="http://jekyllcn.com/">jekyll</a> is a very intersting tools to build a blog.There are many beautiful theme. Unfortunately, I am totally new about <em>html</em> and <em>markdown</em> writting. It is also interesting to use different theme based on jekyll to show a different personality.</p>

<p>If you want to build your personal blog, you can use <a href="http://qiubaiying.github.io">qiubaiying‚Äôs blog</a> as the reference. And there are also some other interesting tools such as <em>Hexo</em>.</p>

<p>There are still questions when I build my blog: <em>why do i need a blog? How long would I insist on writting the articles, and putting them on blog?</em></p>

<p>Actually, I consider a blog a totally different window to show and record myself. On the one hand, talk to myself could help me clear my thought. On the other hand, it is improtant to having a series of integral things to record life in such a fragmented era. Maybe you can realize that I have this blog more about myself than use it as some kind of tool. <strong>However, Welcome to my blog, to my inner world!</strong></p>

<h3 id="contents">contents</h3>
<p>I would put serval kinds of articles on the site: <strong>learning notes</strong>, <strong>little thoughts</strong>, and <strong>life recording</strong></p>

  <p>The process of building a blog shows my disadvantage again: which is that I am easy to be trapped on the road instead of heading to the goal. During my blog building, I was entangled with the blog theme. I have tried about this theme, and the <em>Next</em> theme. I put a lot of time in try differnent interfacre. However, the content is more important for a blog than its look. Looking back, actually I am always doing such things. When I want to learn about computational biology, I have spent a lot of time in installing Linux. I want to change this state, now.</p>
